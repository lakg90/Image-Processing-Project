# Image Processing – Image Provessing (End of Theme Assessment)

This repository contains my completed **Image Processing individual project**, where I apply numerical and programming techniques to analyse and manipulate image data using Python.

---

## Project Overview

The project focuses on working with digital images as numerical arrays and applying fundamental image processing operations. The aim is to demonstrate understanding of how images can be represented, transformed, and analysed computationally.

---

## Key Topics Covered

- Image representation as arrays  
- Pixel-wise operations  
- Image transformations  
- Basic filtering and manipulation  
- Visualisation of image data  
- Clear and structured Python implementation
