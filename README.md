# Facets of Mathematics – Cubic Curves (End of Theme Assessment)

This repository contains my completed **End of Theme Assessment** for the *Facets of Mathematics* course, focusing on **conic and cubic curves over ℂ²**.

The project combines symbolic computation, linear algebra, and algebraic geometry concepts to analyse the existence, uniqueness, and structure of conic and cubic curves passing through prescribed points in the complex plane.

## Project Overview

The notebook investigates geometric and algebraic properties of curves in ℂ² by:

- Studying the existence of **conics passing through five given points**
- Determining **uniqueness and irreducibility** of such conics
- Constructing **cubic curves** subject to geometric constraints
- Using **symbolic computation** to solve polynomial systems
- Supporting analytical arguments with **computational verification**

All results are backed by clear mathematical reasoning and reproducible code.
